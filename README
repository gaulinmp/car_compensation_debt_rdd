**Notes**

	1. The Dealscan database has altered its data structure since the data was pulled for this project in April of 2020.
		The current data structure provided by Dealscan is in panel form, whereas the old structure features loan
		loan characteristics spread across multiple data files. Our code was written to collect and format the
		data in its older form. As such, the code presented here utilizes the following legacy Dealscan datafiles:

		- company.sas7bdat
		- facility.sas7bdat
		- financialcovenant.sas7bdat
		- lendershares.sas7bdat
		- networthcovenant.sas7bdat
		- package.sas7bdat
		- performancepricing.sas7bdat
		- performancepricingcomments.sas7bdat

	2. To link the Dealscan data to other financial databases, we use the link provided by Michael Roberts. This data is
		available on his website: https://finance.wharton.upenn.edu/~mrrobert/research.html. This data is converted
		into a .DTA (STATA) format prior to being uploaded in the "duration_test_data_creation_1.sas" program.

	3. Data from Incentive Lab is from April 2020 and is imported using a STATA format. The Incentive Lab datafiles are as follows:

		- beneown.dta
		- bhown.dta
		- companyfy.dta
		- comppeer.dta
		- consultant.dta
		- dircomp.dta
		- exervest.dta
		- gpbaabs.dta
		- gpbaacc.dta
		- gpbaaccpeer.dta
		- gpbagrant.dta
		- gpbarel.dta
		- gpbarelpeer.dta
		- holdingreq.dta
		- oeoption.dta
		- oestock.dta
		- participantfy.dta
		- sumcomp.dta

	4. Data from Compustat is from March 2021 and is imported using a STATA (.dta) format. Specifically, we utilize the annual fundamental
		file from Compustat, downloaded from WRDS.

	5. Additional compensation data is pulled from EXECUCOMP via WRDS and is combined with DEALSCAN and COMPUSTAT data befre
		 being imported using a STATA (.dta) format.

	6. To link our primary database Incentive Lab we download the file containing GVKEY, CIK and FYEAR from Compustat Annual on the WRDS website (compustat_incentivelab_link.dta)

	7. To link our primary database with bond data from TRACE and FISD we utilize the WRDS LINKS datafiles, specifically the CRSP-COMPUSTAT
		link file and the TRACE_CRSP link file.

	8. Bond return data is pulled from the TRACE Enhanced Dataset accessed via WRDS, and is imported using a STATA (.dta) format.

	9. Equity return data is pulled from CRSP accessed via WRDS and is imported using a STATA (.dta) format.

	10. CDS spread data is obtained from the Markit CDS end of day file and is imported using a STATA (.dta) format. (cds_spreads.dta)

**Order of programs for main analysis (regression discontinuity analysis)**

	1. 01_duration_test_data_creation_1.sas (SAS program)
		--> Requires dealscan link
		--> Requires Dealscan databases listed above
		--> Requires Compustat Annual Fundamentals file
		--> Requires ExecuComp Annual Compensation file
		--> Creates "duration_test_data_1.dta"

	2. 02_clean_combine_IL.do (STATA program)
		--> Requires Incentive Lab databases listed above
		--> Creates "incentivelab_master.dta"

	3. 03_pull_variables.sas (SAS program)
		--> Requires Compustat Annual Fundamentals file downloaded from WRDS (compustat_annual.dta)
		--> Creates "compustat_variables.dta"

	4. 04_lender_relations.sas (SAS program)
		--> Requires dealscan link
		--> Requires "package.sas7bdat", "facility.sas7bdat", "lendershares.sas7bdat" from Dealscan Database
		--> Creates "lender_relations_start_by_packageid.dta"

	5. 05_duration_test_data_creation_2.do (STATA program)
		--> Requires "duration_test_data_1.dta"
		--> Requires "compustat_incentivelab_link.dta" (see note above for creation)
		--> Requires Compustat Annual Fundamentals file
		--> Requires "lender_relations_start_by_packageid.dta"
		--> Creates "duration_test_data_final.dta", the final analysis file for RDD analysis

**Order of programs for CDS, bond return, and equity return analysis (event study analysis)**

	6. 06_cds_eventstudy.do
		--> Requires "cds_spreads.dta" in directory.
		--> Requires loading "duration_test_data_final.dta" from step 4 above
		--> Creates "filing_dates.dta" for CDS, bond and equity event studies
			--> NOTE: It is necessary to construct this file with "cds_eventstudy.do" to perform bond/equity event studies
		--> Creates "cds_final.dta", the final analysis file for CDS event study

	7. 07_bond_eventstudy_enhanced.sas
		--> Requires "filing_dates.dta" in directory
		--> Requires WRDS link for Compustat-CRSP, CRSP-TRACE
		--> Creates "bond_eventstudy.dta"

	8. 08_bond_eventstudy.do
		--> Requires "bond_eventstudy.dta" in directory
		--> Requires "index_ret.dta" in directory; pulled from FRED database (see appendix 3 of paper)
	 	--> Creates "bond_final.dta", the final analysis file for bond event study

	9. 09_equity_eventstudy.do
		--> Requires "filing_dates.dta" in directory
		--> Method involves use of WRDS event study tool
		--> Creates "equity_final.dta", the final analysis file for equity event study

**Dependent Variable Notes**

	Measure of Pay Horizon: total_horizon
		--> Winsorized at (1st, 99th) with replacement; no truncation

	Measure of Accounting Ratio: acct_ratio_wb
		--> Winsorized at (1st, 99th) with replacement; no truncation

	Measure of Short-Horizon Accounting Ratio: acct_short_ratio_wb
		--> Winsorized at (1st, 99th) with replacement; no truncation

**Independent Variable Notes**

	Measure of Distance: dist
		--> Differences between covenant thresholds and corresponding firm levels are winsorized at (1st, 99th) with replacement
			at the covenant-type level (net worth, current ratio) prior to taking the minimum of these differences as dist
